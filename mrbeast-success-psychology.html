                <h1>The Psychology Behind MrBeast's YouTube Success</h1>
                <p>We all know who the biggest YouTube channel is at the moment. That would be MrBeast. However, just like everyone else, MrBeast didn't start that way. If you watch his oldest videos, he didn't have much success.</p>

                <p>So how did someone like MrBeast manage to get so popular?</p>

                <p>The answer is in his videos. If you look at a video on his channel and try to reverse engineer, there are many things implemented to make individuals addicted to his videos. Especially in the current time where the average attention span is extremely short. What MrBeast is using are techniques from consumer behavior and marketing psychology scaled at an extraordinary size.</p>

                <p>Each of his videos is made to flood your brain with dopamine every passing second. So, how does he do that? Take a close look, and you will see that the scenery in each of his videos changes extremely fast, sometimes even milliseconds. This doesn't allow our brain to adjust to the changes, and our brain is constantly trying to figure out what is going to happen next.</p>

                <p>MrBeast carefully crafts his videos with tricks such as those used in ads, but he makes his videos unique and constantly changing. On top of that, most of the content created by MrBeast is not boring, but unique and novel. This makes us love his videos because we as humans love to seek novelty.</p>
